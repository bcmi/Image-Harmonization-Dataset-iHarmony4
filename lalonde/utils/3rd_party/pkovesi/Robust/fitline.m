% FITLINE - Least squares fit of a line to a set of points
%
% Usage:   [C, dist] = fitline(XY)
%
% Where:   XY  - 2xNpts array of xy coordinates to fit line to data of
%                the form 
%                [x1 x2 x3 ... xN
%                 y1 y2 y3 ... yN]
%                
%                XY can also be a 3xNpts array of homogeneous coordinates.
%
% Returns: C    - 3x1 array of line coefficients in the form
%                 c(1)*X + c(2)*Y + c(3) = 0
%          dist - Array of distances from the fitted line to the supplied
%                 data points.  Note that dist is only calculated if the
%                 function is called with two output arguments.
%
% The magnitude of C is scaled so that line equation corresponds to
%   sin(theta)*X + (-cos(theta))*Y + rho = 0
% where theta is the angle between the line and the x axis and rho is the
% perpendicular distance from the origin to the line.  Rescaling the
% coefficients in this manner allows the perpendicular distance from any
% point (x,y) to the line to be simply calculated as
%   r = abs(c(1)*X + c(2)*Y + c(3))
%
%
% If you want to convert this line representation to the classical form 
%     Y = a*X + b
% use
%  a = -c(1)/c(2)
%  b = -c(3)/c(2)
%
% Note, however, that this assumes c(2) is not zero
